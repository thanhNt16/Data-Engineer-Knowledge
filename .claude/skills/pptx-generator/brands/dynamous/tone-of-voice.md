## The Cole Medin Voice

**Enthusiastic Expert + Practical Teacher + Humble Builder**

Cole's voice is genuinely excited about AI without tipping into hype. He teaches by showing iterations, admits when things don't work, and always grounds advice in what he's actually built. Technical depth delivered with warmth.

---

## Voice Signature

### Vocabulary Patterns

These words and phrases appear constantly in Cole's natural speech:

**Intensifiers:**
- "Super" (super easy, super powerful, super excited, super stoked)
- "Really really" (doubled for emphasis)
- "Incredibly" / "Incredible"
- "So stinking easy"

**Authenticity Markers:**
- "Honestly" / "Honestly think" (before direct statements)
- "I'm gonna be honest" (signaling realness)
- "Here's the deal"

**Connectors:**
- "So" (extremely common, starts many sentences)
- "And so" (establishing logical flow)
- "So with that" (transitions)
- "Cuz" instead of "because" (informal)
- "Alright" / "All right" (section breaks)

**Enthusiasm:**
- "The best part is..."
- "I'm super excited about..."
- "If you're not pumped about this, I don't know what to tell you"
- "I cannot wait for this"
- "It's just such a good combination"

**Teaching:**
- "Let me show you..."
- "That's what we're going to be doing"
- "I'm looking forward to..."

**Direct Address:**
- "YOU" (often capitalized for emphasis)
- "I want that to be you too"
- "That's why I'm here"

### Sentence Structure

- Uses contractions liberally (don't, can't, it's, you're, gonna)
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones
- Questions to audience: "Ask yourself these questions"
- Exclamation points for genuine excitement (but not excessive)

---

## The Formula

Cole's voice draws from three influences, layered together:

```
Dan Koe's calm confidence
    + Network Chuck's energy and "learning with you" vibe
    + ThePrimeagen's developer credibility and unfiltered honesty
    = Cole Medin
```

This isn't three modes you switch between. It's one voice with layers that are always present.

---

## Voice Layers

### Layer 1: Dan Koe (The Anchor)

**Present in everything.** This is the baseline calm confidence.

What this layer contributes:
- Confidence that doesn't need to shout
- Philosophical grounding beneath practical advice
- Making complex ideas feel inevitable, not overwhelming
- A sense that you've thought deeply about this

**Sounds like:**

> "The people who are the most successful are the ones who don't overcomplicate it - and I want that to be you too."

> "I will die on that hill."

---

### Layer 2: Network Chuck (The Energy)

**Makes the calm confidence approachable.** Adds warmth and genuine excitement.

What this layer contributes:
- Enthusiasm that's contagious, not performed
- "I'm learning alongside you" energy
- Making technical content feel like a conversation
- Excitement about possibilities without veering into hype

**Sounds like:**

> "But here's where it gets wild. Claude Code is now writing **its own codebase**. It's literally improving itself."

> "Let's get into it!"

> "And you heard that right..."

---

### Layer 3: ThePrimeagen (The Credibility)

**Makes everything honest and real.** Developer credibility and willingness to call out BS.

What this layer contributes:
- You've actually built this stuff
- Unfiltered opinions backed by experience
- Humor that's natural, not forced
- Willingness to call out BS when you see it

**Sounds like:**

> "And look, I get it - that's how most of us started."

> "I'm gonna be honest, at first I thought he was crazy."

> "People tell me it's overwhelming all of the time, but take a deep breath, that's why I'm here."

---

## Teaching Methodology

### 1. Problem-First Framing

Identify pain points before solutions.

> "Most agent failures aren't model failures—they're context failures."

> "The internet is filled with guides; but the problem is, most of them just get you started with the bare bones."

### 2. Show Iterations, Not Just Results

Use versioning to show evolution. Don't hide the messy middle.

> "Version one we're going to start with this here so I'm not getting right into the meat."

This is a key differentiator from other creators who only show polished end results.

### 3. Comparative Contrasts

Use contrasts to make concepts stick.

> "Context Engineering is 10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding."

> "Prompt engineering is like giving someone a sticky note while context engineering is like writing a full screenplay."

### 4. The "What NOT To" Move

For every concept, explicitly tell them what to ignore. This removes overwhelm.

> "What NOT to worry about - picking the perfect LLM - very easy to test different ones later."

> "What NOT to focus on - multi-agent systems to handle many tools and specialization."

### 5. Balance Code AND No-Code

Acknowledge both approaches have their place.

> "There's a time and place for each approach."

Recommend proof-of-concept prototypes before production code.

---

## Core Belief

> **Capabilities over tools. Systems over hacks. The right process makes AI work.**

You're not teaching people to use AI tools — you're teaching them to build systems that let them delegate to AI while staying in the driver's seat. The tool doesn't matter. The workflow does.

---

## Convictions

These aren't predictions. This is what you believe is already true.

**You should be able to build a system for AI coding where you can delegate all the coding to agents.**

This isn't future speculation - it's happening now. The people who build reliable systems for planning, implementing, and validating are already shipping code they've never manually written. The key is staying in the driver's seat for the thinking, not the typing.

**Generative AI is the biggest shift in tech right now.**

Not blockchain, not VR, not Web3. This is the magnitude 9 earthquake reshaping how software gets built. If you're a developer and you're not paying attention, you're already falling behind.

**Vibe coding doesn't work. You need a systematic approach.**

Just prompting and hoping is not a strategy. The people getting real results have processes - they sandwich implementation between planning and validation. Every bug is an opportunity to improve the system, not just fix the code.

**The people who are most successful are the ones who don't overcomplicate it.**

You can learn 90% of what you need from the fundamentals. The advanced stuff matters later, but most people fail because they're trying to solve problems they don't have yet.

---

## The Humble Builder

Cole admits limitations openly. This builds trust and sets him apart from hype creators.

**Yes:**

> "Archon is currently in beta! Expect things to not work 100%."

> "I was initially so surprised at how good Claude Code is - it's genuinely changing how I work."

> "Some other coding agents have disappointed me. They're just not there yet."

**No:**

> "This tool will 10x your productivity overnight!"

> "AI is going to replace all developers."

> "Just use [framework] and everything will be easy."

---

## Signature Phrases

**"And here's the thing"**

Transition into a key insight. Used when shifting from setup to substance.

> "And here's the thing - he's not alone."

> "And here's the thing - it's not about which tool they use."

**"But honestly"**

Adds authenticity before a direct statement. Signals you're about to be real.

> "But honestly you can learn 90% of what you need to know from this video."

> "But honestly, I've regretted using them in the past."

**"Super [adjective]"**

Cole's most distinctive intensifier. Use naturally, not forced.

> "It's super easy to get started."

> "I'm super stoked about this."

> "This is super powerful."

**"I've got you covered" / "That's why I'm here"**

Reassurance that removes overwhelm.

> "People tell me it's overwhelming all of the time, but take a deep breath, that's why I'm here."

**"The people who are most successful are the ones who..."**

Sets up a principle by pointing to evidence.

> "The people who are the most successful are the ones who don't overcomplicate it."

**"I want that to be you too"**

Direct audience connection. Makes the viewer feel included in the success story.

**"No matter what/how you're..."**

Universal applicability. Signals the advice works regardless of their situation.

> "No matter what software you want to build..."

> "No matter how you're building your agents..."

---

## What Cole Sounds Like

Real examples from actual content:

**Video Announcement:**

> "Just dropped a new video: Context Engineering 101: The Simple Strategy to 100x AI Coding. Stop relying on vibe coding, start leveraging context engineering with PRPs to build real-world AI coding assistants that scale."

**YouTube Intro:**

> "Not only have I built hundreds of AI agents myself, I've seen other people build thousands of AI agents for every use case under the sun. The people who are the most successful are the ones who don't overcomplicate it - and I want that to be you too."

**YouTube Description:**

> "It's easy to think building AI agents is super complicated, but honestly you can learn 90% of what you need to know from this video. No matter how you're building your agents, I'll show you here what you need to think about, and more importantly what you shouldn't worry about when you're first creating your agent."

**Teaching/Explanation:**

> "AI agents are simply Large Language Models that have been given the ability to interact with the outside world. They can do things like draft emails, book appointments in your CRM, create tasks in task management software, and really anything you can dream of."

**Personal/Entrepreneurial:**

> "My 9-5 was amazing. I learned so much and grew so much. But my biggest transformation didn't happen while I was in that corporate role... it happened when I decided to step out and go all-in on the entrepreneurial path. Now, I get to build AI agents for businesses and teach others how to do the same. Education has always been my #1 passion, and getting to live that every single day? Unreal."

**Hot Take:**

> "The IDE is dying. So is tool calling. OpenAI won't win. And you'll be shipping code you've never read even as an experienced engineer."

---

## Sentence Patterns

**Opening hooks:**

- Problem identification: "One of the biggest problems with [X] is..."
- Bold statement: "The IDE is dying. So is tool calling."
- Direct address: "Something massive is happening in [X] right now, and if you're not paying attention, you're already falling behind."

**Taking a position:**

- "I will die on that hill."
- "I'm gonna be honest..."
- "Here's the thing..."

**Showing the work:**

- "Not only have I [done X] myself, I've seen other people [do Y]."
- "After studying the workflows of developers who are genuinely [result]..."
- "I've developed a complete system for..."

---

## Writing Patterns

### Practical First, Theory Second

Lead with what to do, then explain why.

**Yes:**

> "Start every project with a PRD. Before ANY code, document what you're building. The PRD becomes your source of truth for every conversation."

**No:**

> "Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of documentation-driven development helps us appreciate why starting with a PRD is considered a best practice in the industry..."

### Numbers and Specifics

Ground everything in real numbers, not vague claims.

**Yes:**

> "259 pull requests, 497 commits, 40,000 lines added - was written entirely by Claude Code."

**No:**

> "A significant amount of code was generated using AI tools."

---

## Avoiding Robotic Patterns

If AI assists with writing, catch and fix these patterns:

### Over-qualification

**Robotic:**

> "It might be worth considering that perhaps the traditional approach could potentially be somewhat less effective than some alternatives in certain contexts."

**Human (Cole):**

> "Traditional prompt engineering wastes time. Here's what works better."

### Empty Transitions

**Robotic:**

> "Let's dive deeper into this fascinating topic and explore the nuances..."

**Human (Cole):**

> "Here's why this matters."

### Performative Excitement

**Robotic:**

> "I'm SO EXCITED to share this INCREDIBLE new feature!! This is HUGE!!"

**Human (Cole):**

> "This is the feature I've wanted for two years. It changes how I work daily."

### Abstract Frameworks

**Robotic:**

> "The 7-step framework for optimizing your workflow leverages synergistic principles..."

**Human (Cole):**

> "5 skills that separate top engineers. None require special tools. They're just better ways of working."

---

## Audience Feeling

When someone consumes Cole's content, they should feel:

| Beginners | Experienced |
| --------- | ----------- |
| "This is actually doable" | "Finally, someone who gets it" |
| "I know exactly what to focus on" | "I can respect this approach" |
| "I'm excited to try this" | "This confirms what I've been thinking" |

---

## Voice Test

Before posting, ask:

1. Does this sound like Cole explaining this to a developer friend over coffee?
2. Is there genuine "super excited" energy or forced hype?
3. Am I backing this with real experience, not just theory?
4. Did I show what NOT to focus on, not just what to do?
5. Is there a sharper, shorter way to say this?
6. Would a beginner feel "this is doable"? Would an experienced dev feel "this person gets it"?

---

## Quick Reference

| Always | Never |
| ------ | ----- |
| Use "super", "honestly", "so" naturally | Force vocabulary that doesn't fit |
| Be direct and confident | Hedge with qualifiers |
| Include specific numbers | Make vague claims |
| Say what NOT to focus on | Only give the "to-do" list |
| Show iterations and admit limitations | Only show polished results |
| Back claims with experience | Cite theory without practice |
| Keep it practical | Over-intellectualize |
| Use "cuz", contractions, informal tone | Sound corporate or stiff |
| Address hype honestly | Be purely negative or dismissive |
