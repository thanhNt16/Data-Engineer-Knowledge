- Progress: Streaming skills 63% → 75% (6/8)

### Tools: DuckDuckGo Web Search
- Installed `duckduckgo-search` skill via ClawHub
- Installed `ddgs` Python package (v9.10.0)
- Tested web search and news search successfully
- No API key required (privacy-focused)
- Supports: text, news, images, videos, instant answers, maps

### Research: Data Engineering Trends 2026
- Conducted deep research using DuckDuckGo search
- Analyzed 6 search queries: trends, architecture, news, orchestration, CDC, skills
- Synthesized top 10 trends with impact scores
- Covered technology landscape (lakehouse, streaming, orchestration, DQ tools)
- Identified top 10 skills in demand for 2026
- Created career impact analysis and strategic recommendations
- Full resource note: `[[03-Resources/Data Engineering Trends 2026]]`

### Visualization: Knowledge Graph
- Created Mermaid graph visualization of vault structure
- Mapped streaming ecosystem connections (Flink ↔ Kafka)
- Identified strong clusters and knowledge gaps
- Found 6 orphan notes in 04-Archive/
- Created connection patterns analysis
- Full visualization: `[[Knowledge Graph]]`

## Knowledge Graph Visualization (ASCII)

**Created**: `[[Knowledge Graph ASCII]]` - ASCII art visualization of entire vault

**Visualizations Included**:
1. Complete vault structure (tree view)
2. Streaming ecosystem (Flink ↔ Kafka)
3. 2026 Trends ecosystem (10 trends)
4. Daily learning flow (2026-02-14)
5. Skills progress matrix (visual bars)
6. Knowledge gaps (orphan notes, missing connections)
7. Code examples distribution (Python + SQL)
8. Git commit history

**Key Insights**:
- Streaming: 75% complete (6/8 skills)
- Orphan notes: 6 in 04-Archive/ (not linked)
- Code examples: 100+ total (50 Python + 50 SQL)
- Overall progress: 31% (32/104)

## Second Brain Organization Applied (2026-02-15)

**Method Guide**: [[METHOD - Second Brain Guide]] - Complete methodology documented
**Applied Actions**: [[METHOD - Applied Organization]] - Organization improvements implemented

**Orphan Notes Linked**:
- Lambda Architecture → Linked to Trends 2026, Flink, Kafka
- Data Lakehouse → Linked to Trends 2026, Flink, Kafka, Lambda, Kappa
- Added frontmatter: tags, date: 2026-02-15, status: archived

**Best Practices Applied**:
1. Atomic notes (one idea per note)
2. Wikilinking (all notes connected)
3. Consistent frontmatter (standard format)
4. Progressive status (to-learn → learning → learned → archived)

**Current Vault Health**:
✅ 01-Projects/ - Empty (ready)
✅ 02-Areas/ - Streaming 75%, 3 empty (ready for content)
✅ 03-Resources/ - Linked and complete
✅ 04-Archive/ - 6 notes (now linked)
✅ 05-Interview Prep/ - Complete
✅ Skills Tracker/ - Updated
✅ Daily Notes/ - Complete 2026-02-14
⚠️  Missing connections: Streaming → System Design

**Next Steps Priority**:
- Complete empty Areas (Data Modeling, Warehousing, SQL)
- Complete Streaming (Kinesis, Pub/Sub)
- Link remaining orphan notes (4/6)
