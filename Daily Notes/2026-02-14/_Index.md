# Daily Notes - 2026-02-14

## Learning Activities

### Streaming: Apache Flink
- Created comprehensive Apache Flink reference in `[[02-Areas/Streaming/Apache Flink - Real-Time Analytics]]`
- Covered: Architecture, time semantics, windowing, state management, exactly-once semantics
- Interview prep: 5 key questions with answers
- Progress: Streaming skills 0% → 63% (5/8)

### Streaming: Apache Kafka
- Created comprehensive Kafka reference with hands-on examples in `[[02-Areas/Streaming/Apache Kafka - Event Streaming]]`
- Covered: Topics, partitions, producers, consumers, consumer groups, rebalancing
- Examples: Python producer/consumer code, exactly-once semantics, compacted topics
- Interview prep: 5 key questions with answers
- Progress: Streaming skills 63% → 75% (6/8)

### Tools: DuckDuckGo Web Search
- Installed `duckduckgo-search` skill via ClawHub
- Installed `ddgs` Python package (v9.10.0)
- Tested web search and news search successfully
- No API key required (privacy-focused)
- Supports: text, news, images, videos, instant answers, maps

### Research: Data Engineering Trends 2026
- Conducted deep research using DuckDuckGo search
- Analyzed 6 search queries: trends, architecture, news, orchestration, CDC, skills
- Synthesized top 10 trends with impact scores
- Covered technology landscape (lakehouse, streaming, orchestration, DQ tools)
- Identified top 10 skills in demand for 2026
- Created career impact analysis and strategic recommendations
- Full resource note: `[[03-Resources/Data Engineering Trends 2026]]`

### Visualization: Knowledge Graph
- Created Mermaid graph visualization of vault structure
- Mapped streaming ecosystem connections (Flink ↔ Kafka)
- Identified strong clusters and knowledge gaps
- Found 6 orphan notes in 04-Archive/
- Created connection patterns analysis
- Full visualization: `[[Knowledge Graph]]`
