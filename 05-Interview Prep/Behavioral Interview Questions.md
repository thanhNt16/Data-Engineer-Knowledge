## The STARR Method

The STARR method is a framework for organizing your responses during behavioral interviews:

### S - Situation
Explain the context of your circumstance, including:
- Where you worked
- Whom you worked with
- Other pertinent information

### T - Task
Explain the assignment or difficulty:
- What was the goal or objective?
- What were you trying to accomplish?

### A - Action
Explain the steps you followed:
- What steps did you take?
- Why did you choose those actions?

### R - Result
Explain how your activities turned out:
- How did your actions affect the circumstance?
- Did you meet your aim or objective?

### R - Reflection
Consider what you learned from the experience:
- What would you do differently?
- What worked well?
- How can you build on that success?
