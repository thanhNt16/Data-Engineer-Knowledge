**Description**:  
A flexible storage system for vast amounts of raw, unstructured, and semi-structured data without enforcing a strict schema.

**Characteristics**:

- Raw data storage in native format.
- Scalability for large data volumes.
- Schema-on-read (schema applied during retrieval).

**Benefits**:

- Flexibility to store structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
- Highly scalable for big data workloads.
- Cost-effective storage for massive datasets.

**Challenges**:

- Without proper governance, a data lake can become a "data swamp."
- Query performance can be slower compared to data warehouses.

**Use Cases**:

- Big data analytics.
- Machine learning and data science.
- Storage of log and event data.

**Example**:  
A healthcare provider stores patient records, medical images, and sensor data for analysis and research in a data lake.
